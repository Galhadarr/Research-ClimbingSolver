# Research Method class project - Climbing as a search problem

## Overview
The Climbing Path Optimizer is a sophisticated tool designed to assist climbers in finding the optimal path on a modeled climbing wall. Leveraging advanced algorithms such as A* for efficient pathfinding and STRIP planning for a logical sequence of moves, this program provides a solution to navigate complex climbing routes with ease.

## Features
Advanced Pathfinding: Utilizes the A* algorithm to ensure the most efficient path is chosen, taking into account various factors.
STRIP Planning Integration: Incorporates STRIP planning to generate a logical sequence of moves, ensuring each step is feasible and contributes to the overall goal of reaching the top.
Visual Path Representation: Offers a visual representation of the chosen path, making it easier to understand and follow in real-life applications.
